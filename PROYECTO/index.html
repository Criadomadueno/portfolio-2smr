          <button class="accordion">PHILOSOPHY</button>
            <div class="panel">
            <a href="https://encyclopaedia.herdereditorial.com/wiki/Autor:Marco_Aurelio">
            <img  id= "marco-aurelio" src="./img/marcoaurelio.png" alt="Marco Aurelio">

    <hr><br>
    <p id="p4">If I could have eternal life, I would spend it all reading about the great thinkers. The human mind is beautiful.</p>
    <p id="p4">Since I was in the adolescence, I began to reading the History of the Philosophy in the Bachelor. At first, I was afraid and scared about Philosophy, because I thought that this subject was obscure and very boring. Poor me! I couldn't be more wrong. When I first read Plato's dialogues, I fell in love with the reasonings about the most importants questions of the humanity. What is the Truth? What is the Happiness? I've never did these questions before. Since that moment, I've gained counsciousness about life, and it was a no-return way. Now, I really <b>need</b> to know every aspect of knowledge. I get pleased every time I found a new path to wisdom.  </p>
    <p id="p4">In general, I like all the categories of Philosophy (Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics, philosophy of culture...) but I specially love the Existentialism. I don't know. These philosophers have something that attracts me. My favourite philosopher is Albert Camus: an existentialist, of course! He wasn't just a philosopher, but a novelist. He earned a Nobel Prize because of his novel <i>The Stranger</i>. My favourite book of all time it's from him, and it's called <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> </p>
    <p id="p4">Also I like a lot of subjects like Mythology, Theology, Anthropology, or Evolution Theory. I get excited every time I read how humans from different continents have a similar point of view about the "Hero Journey", I mean, every culture shares a similar pattern in his heroes, gods and myths. Thats a very interesting topic theorized by Joseph Campbell in his book <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> (I strongly recommend this book, because his work is the inspiration of the majority of the Hollywood writers. Joseph Campbell build the well-known "Hero path" or "Monomyth")</p>

    <button class="accordion">VIDEOGAMES</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p id="p4">It's said that cinematography is the seventh art. Well, if thats true, then, the videogames are the eighth. I believe that the only thing that separates films from games is the fact that the player can be an active part of the story instead of simply being a passive spectator.</p>
  <p id="p4">I'm not gonna lie if I tell you that some 'gaming-moments' I've experienced gave me goosebumps. Saving your people, defending the country, travel over the world to stand up on the top of the mountain, to simply look at the beautiful of the horizon... Isn't that enough to convince you? Then you need to see:</p>

    <div class="col-4">
      <img src="./img/skyrim-beautiful3.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="480">
    </div>
  </div>
  <p id="p4">And that's not all. Not to mention about the immersive soundtrack and the beautiful orchestra of some videogames. They are simply beautiful. I think mixing these things and the possibility of choosing our path are truly an unique experience. </p>
  <p id="p4">(aand... If you don't notice, yes! Skyrim is my favourite game :P)</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">COMPUTING</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p id="p4">The art of automate tasks and make life easier... Isn't awesome? We can achieve great things if we support people by creating new technologies and dominating the digital world. Medics needs more advanced tools, like so need other professions. So, let's work on it. Let's work on the goal of improve the people's life.  </p>
  <p id="p4">First time I went into computing was when I was eight years old. I felt so fascinated about the Windows XP interface. I loved the way that the interface worked, and all the things I could do. I remember the MSN Messenger, the minigames, the old and mysterious Youtube. Everything was so unreal then. Now I became more conscious, and that magic had decreased... Until I entered in the CPIFP Alan Turing! I don't know that computing could be so interesting!! Now I'm in love with the Linux command line interface, and I consider that "green and black" themed prompts in older screens are soooooooo hypnotic... I guess this is only the beggining, and I'm so excited about that.  </p>
    <div class="fotoibm"><img src="./img/ibm-pc.png" alt="" id="ibm-pc" width="350" height="300"></div>
  <p id="p5">I mean, look at this PC. It's perfect (for looking at, not for using 😂) </p>

<button class="accordion">MUSIC</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p id="p4">I really LOVE hearing music. I can't tell you my favourite genre because I consider myself very eclectic in music. I can listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7i3ugniyjg">electronic</a> all day, but other day I can spend all day listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6qMQnNst9U">Vicente Fernández</a>.

<button class="accordion">FILMS</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p id="p4">I enjoy all the well done works. A good film for me has to be very entertaining, and, above all: it must have a good story. If a film don't have a meaning, at least, put a lot of explosions and guns and chaos. </p>
  <p id="p4">The directors are very important too, because they print their unique singature among all the film. For example, Stanley Kubrick doesn't work the same way Michael Bay does. I really like the psychological films, so it's inevitable liking the Kubrick's movies, also those of Christopher Nolan. If I could rank directors, my personal ranking maybe is 1. Stanley Kubrick , 2. Ridley Scott and 3. Steven Spielberg.  </p>
  <p id="p4">Also, this is a list of my favourite movies:</p>
